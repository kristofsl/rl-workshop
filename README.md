# rl-workshop

An implementation of deep Q-learning in keras for the balancing pole and the lunar lander problem in the open AI gym (currently gymnasium) environment
The implementation has the following tweaks:

- replay memory
- adding extra feedback to the reward signal to keep the pole in the middle area
  
## Run option

- you can create a virtual environment in python and install all the requirements and run the python file
- you can use the google colab version 

## Dependencies

- Keeping track of the runs with MLflow
- Hyperparameter tuning with optuna
